**Description:** Symmetry describes the intrinsic structure and properties of a subject. In this course, we will explore the symmetries in geometry and rigorously express them in mathematics, covering relevant topics in group theory, differential geometry, representation theory, and Lie groups. Then, we will use them as tools to achieve computationally efficient and generalizable algorithms for learning, perception, estimation, and control with applications in many domains, such as AI, computer vision, and robotics. The course will cover novel topics in geometric learning and explores state of the art in symmetry-preserving and geometric learning methods.
