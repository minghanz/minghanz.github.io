Hello! I am a postdoctoral research fellow jointly appointed at the University of Michigan [CURLY lab](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/) and the University of Pennsylvania [DAIR lab](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/). I obtained my Ph. D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan, under the supervision of [Prof. Huei Peng](https://huei.engin.umich.edu/) and [Prof. Maani Ghaffari](https://name.engin.umich.edu/people/ghaffari-maani/). 

My research focus is on 3D geometric learning for robotic and autonomous driving applications. I am especially interested in robust and efficient representation learning using equivariant methods. 

Please check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=70CbUXwAAAAJ&hl=en) page for the full list of my publications.
